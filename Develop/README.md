![Walk through video.](./assets/video/demo_video.gif)

When the user runs `node index.js`, the program runs the `inquirer` package to prompt the user in the command line interface with a series of questions about your project.  The program then takes your response and automatically generates markdown based on the user’s responses.  If certain questions are not indicated, the program will prompt again for an answer.  The generation of markdown for the README.md is created with the `fs.writeFile` command.
